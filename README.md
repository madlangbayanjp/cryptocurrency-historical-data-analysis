# ðŸ“Š Cryptocurrency Historical Data Analysis

This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of historical data for four major cryptocurrencies: **Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Dogecoin (DOGE)**.  
The goal is to extract meaningful insights from their past performance, providing a foundation for understanding market trends and behaviors.

## Project Overview
The core of this project involved a multi-step process:

1. **Data Acquisition & Cleaning**  
   Historical data for each of the four cryptocurrencies was gathered. Python was extensively used to clean and preprocess these datasets, ensuring data quality and consistency.

2. **Data Export**  
   Once cleaned, the refined datasets were exported as `.csv` files.

3. **Insight Extraction (Excel)**  
   The cleaned `.csv` files were then imported into DBeaver for in-depth analysis and the extraction of various market insights.

## Dataset Columns
Each cryptocurrency dataset includes the following columns:

- **Date**: The specific date of the observation.  
- **Open**: The opening price of the cryptocurrency on the given day.  
- **High**: The highest price reached by the cryptocurrency on the given day.  
- **Low**: The lowest price reached by the cryptocurrency on the given day.  
- **Close**: The closing price of the cryptocurrency on the given day.  
- **Volume**: The total volume of transactions for the cryptocurrency on the given day.  
- **Market Cap**: The market capitalization of the cryptocurrency in USD on the given day.

## Key Insights Derived
Based on the cleaned historical data, the following insights were extracted:

- **Volatility Per Month** â†’ Analysis of price fluctuations on a monthly basis to understand the stability or instability of each cryptocurrency.  
- **Daily Return** â†’ Calculation of daily percentage changes in price to assess short-term profitability or loss.  
- **Market Share of Market Cap** â†’ Comparative analysis showing the proportion of total market capitalization held by each cryptocurrency.  
- **Monthly Aggregate** â†’ Summarized monthly performance data, including averages and total volumes.  
- **Price Movement** â†’ General trends and patterns observed in price changes over the historical period.
